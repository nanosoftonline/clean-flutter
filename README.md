# Clean Architecture CRM (Customer relationship management)

In this project, we'll use the process of creating a CRM application to discuss a [Robert C Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) philosophy called Clean Architecture.

We'll be using Flutter/Dart

### Use Cases of the Application
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a strategy that companies use to manage interactions (or tasks) with customers and potential customers (leads).

A use case, the essence of the application, is a written description of how users will perform tasks in your application. It outlines, from a user's point of view, a system's behavior as it responds to a request.

We'll implement the following use cases:
##### Customers
* Get all customers
* Create customer
* Update customer information
* Make customer inactive
* Make customer active
* Delete customer
 
##### Leads (Potential Customers )
* Get all leads
* Create new lead
* Convert lead to customer
* Update lead details

##### Tasks
* Get all activities for customer
* Create customer task
   

### What is Clean Architecture?
"Clean Architecture" was coined by [Robert C Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) and is a software design philosophy that organizes code in such a way that business logic is kept separate from technical implementation (databases, APIs, frameworks). This makes application functionality easy to maintain, change and test.

Clean Architecture allow us to change the presentation (UI or consumer facing parts) or data source (databases, API or backend parts) easily without affecting business logic (use cases).

A more contextual front-end application illustration of clean architecture would be the following image which illustrates flow of control and data.

</div>

The pubspec.yaml file (located at the root of the project) specifies dependencies that the project requires, such as particular packages (and their versions). Let's install a few Flutter/Dart dependencies: 
* **Equatable** for object comparison
* **Dio** for HTTP calls
* **Mockito** for mocking dependencies in our tests
* **dartz** to help with functional programming in Dart
* **uuid** to genereate unique ids

```yaml
//pubspec.yaml

  sdk: ">=2.18.2 <3.0.0"

  mockito: ^5.3.2
  build_runner: ^2.3.0
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```

### Models
In any application, the first place to start would be the models of the application. Models typically represent real-world objects that are related to the problem or domain space. 

##### Customer Model
```dart
//lib/domain/models/customer.dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

enum CustomerType {
  lead,
  customer,
}

class Customer extends Equatable {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String email;
  final CustomerType customerType;
  final bool isActive;

  const Customer({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.email,
    this.isActive = true,
    this.customerType = CustomerType.customer,
  });

  @override
  List<Object> get props {
    return [id, name, email, isActive, customerType];
  }
}

```

##### Task Model

 ```dart
 //lib/domain/models/task.dart
 import 'package:crm/domain/models/customer.dart';

enum Status { notStarted, inProgress, completed }

enum Priority { low, normal, high }

class Task {
  final String id;
  final Customer customer;
  final Priority priority;
  final String subject;
  final Status status;
  final DateTime dueDate;

  const Task({
    required this.id,
    required this.customer,
    this.priority = Priority.high,
    this.status = Status.notStarted,
    required this.subject,
    required this.dueDate,
  });
}

 ```

### Error and Exception Handling
Typically exceptions and errors are caught and handled by using "try-catch" blocks wrapping a piece of code that might throw. Functions like these are said to have side effects.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="docs/side_effects.png"  width="600px"/>
</div>

Languages like Java, allow you used to use the keyword "throws" to mark a function that might have exception side effects. The Dart language does not allow you to mark functions as potentially throwing, we typically allow the error to bubble up to a point where it can be centrally handled (typically near the UI). There is nothing wrong with this. We would like to however take a different approach. Instead of throwing exceptions, we'd like to catch side-effect exceptions and channel the failure to the function's return value.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="docs/side_effects_no_side_effects.png"  width="600px"/>
</div>

This is a Functional Programming (FP) approach of creating pure functions (functions without side effects). The [**dartz**](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz) package gives us the ability to write Dart in a more FP way. It has a type called **Either**  which is used to represent a value that can have two possible types. We'll use this type as our deterministic return type of the function

Let's define the Failure type
```dart
//lib/core/error/failures.dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

abstract class Failure extends Equatable {
  const Failure([List props = const <dynamic>[]]);
}
```

We see this in action in our customer repository interface/contract.

```dart
//lib/domain/repository/interfaces/customer_repository.dart
import 'package:crm/core/error/failures.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/model/customer.dart';

import "package:dartz/dartz.dart";

abstract class CustomerRepository {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Customer>>> getAllCustomers(CustomerType customerType);
  Future<Either<Failure, Customer>> getCustomer(String id);
  Future<Either<Failure, Unit>> createCustomer(Customer data);
  Future<Either<Failure, Unit>> deleteCustomer(String id);
  Future<Either<Failure, Unit>> updateCustomer(
    String id, {
    String? name,
    String? email,
    CustomerType? customerType,
    bool? isActive,
  });
}


```

#### TDD

##### Use Case: Get All Customers
Before we create the "Get all customers" use case implemenation, let's define an interface or contract for it.

```dart
//lib/domain/use_cases/customer/get_all_customers.dart
import 'package:crm/core/error/failures.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/model/customer.dart';
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

abstract class GetAllCustomers {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Customer>>> execute();
}
```


Using TDD, we'll create the implementation of this interface. We'll use the same file to hold the implementation.

The whole process of TDD can be broken down into these steps:

* Write test code, but it doesnâ€™t compile (of course).
* Write production code to make test compile.
* Write test code that compiles but fails an assertion.
* Write production code to pass assertion.

Let's write the first test.
```dart
//test/domain/use_cases/customer/get_all_customers_test.dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:mockito/annotations.dart';

import 'package:crm/domain/repositories/interfaces/customer_repository.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/use_cases/customer/get_all_customers.dart';

import 'get_all_customers_test.mocks.dart';

@GenerateMocks([CustomerRepository])
void main() {
  late CustomerRepository mockCustomerRepository;
  late GetAllCustomers usecase;

  setUp(() {
    mockCustomerRepository = MockCustomerRepository();
    usecase = GetAllCustomersImpl(mockCustomerRepository);
  });

  test("should get all customers from the customer repository", () async {
   
  });
}
```


##### Test Result: 
```
Failed to load "get_all_customers_test.dart": Compilation failed
```

Lets discuss mocks before we fix the test.
##### *A note on Mocks*
Because the "get all customers" use case has a customer repository dependency, we need to mock the customer repository based on the customer repository interface.
We add the generate attribute to our test to instruct Dart to generate mocks and place it next to the test file.

```dart
@GenerateMocks([CustomerRepository])
```

To use Mockito's generated mock classes, add a build_runner dependency in your package's pubspec.yaml file, under dev_dependencies; something like build_runner: ^1.11.0. We then generate the mocks by running the following command in the project folder

```
$> flutter pub run build_runner build
```
Once the mock is generated you can import it 

```dart
import 'get_all_customers_test.mocks.dart';
```

The setup of the test is now complete but the test fails because the class "GetAllCustomersImpl" does not exist. 

Let's write some production code to make the test pass
```dart
//lib/domain/use-cases/customer/get_all_customers.dart
import 'package:crm/core/error/failures.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/model/customer.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/repositories/interfaces/customer_repository.dart';
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

abstract class GetAllCustomers {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Customer>>> execute();
}

class GetAllCustomersImpl implements GetAllCustomers {
  final CustomerRepository customerRepository;

  GetAllCustomersImpl(this.customerRepository);

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Customer>>> execute() async {
    return const Right([]);
  }
}
```
##### Test Result
```
All tests passed!  
```

Let's write a test that compiles but fails assertion,

```dart
  test("should get all customers from the customer repository", () async {
    Either<Failure, List<Customer>> repoResult = const Right<Failure, List<Customer>>([
      Customer(
        id: "123",
        email: "john@company.com",
        name: "John",
      ),
      Customer(
        id: "124",
        email: "jane@company.com",
        name: "Jane",
      )
    ]);

    when(mockCustomerRepository.getAllCustomers()).thenAnswer((_) async => repoResult);

    final result = await usecase.execute();

    expect(result, equals(repoResult));
  });
```

##### Test Result: 
```
  Expected: Right<Failure, List<Customer>>:<Right([Customer(123, John, john@company.com, true, CustomerType.customer), Customer(124, Jane, jane@company.com, true, CustomerType.customer)])>
    Actual: Right<Failure, List<Customer>>:<Right([])>
```

We can make it pass by simply hard coding a result

```dart
//lib/domain/use_cases/customer/get_all_customers.dart
import 'package:crm/core/error/failures.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/model/customer.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/repositories/interfaces/customer_repository.dart';
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

abstract class GetAllCustomers {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Customer>>> execute();
}

class GetAllCustomersImpl implements GetAllCustomers {
  final CustomerRepository customerRepository;

  GetAllCustomersImpl(this.customerRepository);

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Customer>>> execute() async {
    var result = await customerRepository.getAllCustomers();
    return const Right<Failure, List<Customer>>([
        Customer(
        id: "123",
        email: "john@company.com",
        name: "John",
      ),
      Customer(
        id: "124",
        email: "jane@company.com",
        name: "Jane",
      )
    ]);
  }
}

```

This is kind of silly, but it shows that our test is not good enough. In our test we need to verify that the repository was called, so we add a verify line to our test

```dart
...
    expect(result, equals(repoResult));
    verify(mockCustomerRepository.getAllCustomers());
...
```

##### Test Result:
```
 No matching calls (actually, no calls at all).
```

Let's fix it by writing better production code

```dart
//lib/domain/use_cases/customer/get_all_customers.dart
import 'package:crm/core/error/failures.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/model/customer.dart';
import 'package:crm/domain/repositories/interfaces/customer_repository.dart';
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

abstract class GetAllCustomers {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Customer>>> execute();
}

class GetAllCustomersImpl implements GetAllCustomers {
  final CustomerRepository customerRepository;

  GetAllCustomersImpl(this.customerRepository);

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Customer>>> execute() async {
    var result = await customerRepository.getAllCustomers();
    return result;
  }
}
```


And this completes the test and production code for "get all customers" use case.

#### The Remaining Use Cases

Using the same process, through TDD we can code up the remaining use cases. please check the [github repo](https://github.com/nanosoftonline/clean-flutter) for the other production code and tests


##### Customer Repository
Moving up the system architecture the next component we need to tackle is the Customer Repository
